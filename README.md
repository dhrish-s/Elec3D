Description:
Elec3D is a custom-built, interactive 3D visualization tool for circuit layouts. It takes a simple JSON file describing electronic components and their connections, and renders them in a fully 3D OpenGL environment. Components (like resistors or capacitors) are shown as 3D shapes, wires are drawn between them, and users can orbit around the scene, zoom, toggle layout layers, and even animate signal flow along wires. The tool is built for clarity, learning, and rapid developmentâ€”making it perfect for a graphics class and directly relevant to real-world EDA tools used in industry.
